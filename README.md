### 💡 About The Project

This repository houses the source code for my personal portfolio. I built this to not only showcase my projects but to serve as a digital business card that reflects my personality: **clean code, creative design, and user-centric thinking.**

It acts as the central hub for my freelance services, connecting my development work with potential clients.

#### Key Features
* **Aesthetic UI:** Focused on typography, whitespace, and micro-interactions.
* **Fully Responsive:** optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* **Performance First:** scoring 90+ on Google Lighthouse.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** (If applicable)
